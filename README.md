# Leetcode challenge v_02

About few month ago I have challenged myself todo at least one leetcode problem per day. I have kept the streak for up to 40 day (39 to be precise). During that period I could say that I've been tackling challenges of random category and difficulty. Now I am challenging leetcode once again, this time I am gonna be more proactive and plan things ahead. The plan is following: for next 30 days each day I am going to take a single or mutliple problem from Array&Hashing category. Particular problem to be solve and conditions for solving, if any, will be decided on at the morging of the day, also each day I'll try "daily challenge".
