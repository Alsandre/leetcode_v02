# Leetcode challenge v_02

About few month ago I have challenged myself todo at least one leetcode problem per day. I have kept the streak for up to 40 day (39 to be precise). During that period I could say that I've been tackling challenges of random category and difficulty. Now I am challenging leetcode once again, this time I am gonna be more proactive and plan things ahead. The plan is following: for next 30 days each day I am going to take a single or mutliple problem from Array&Hashing category. Particular problem to be solve and conditions for solving, if any, will be decided on at the morging of the day, also each day I'll try "daily challenge".

### Day 1 - The Intro

===

- **Daily challenge**: _3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix_
  - I've implemented brute approach, but it does not meet the time requirements
  - I've improved brute approach too meet time requirments

### Day 2 - The Plan

===
I decide to take arrays on, there are 1749 problems 364-easy 947-med 438-med. goal would be to finish all easy problem and if fulfilled and there is time left till deadline (which is 24-10-24) move on to the medium ones. Additionally, if daily challenge is of medium rate I'll finish it off.
